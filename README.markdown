# PageRegexFile - Convert page source using Regex into text file.

This project Is coded just for self using, You are free to use it or edit the codes.
I use this to get more than 3 thousands of titles from a wiki.
After getting data, You can convert the data into XML or any other file formats.

NOTE: This project only returns row text files in text format.
Text entries and regex matches are stored on a new line by each.
